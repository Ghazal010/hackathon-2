## Project Identity
- Project: Todo App - In-Memory Python Console Application
- Phase: I
- Deadline: January 2, 2026

1. All code must be generated using Claude Code (no manual coding)
2. All features must be specified in markdown files before implementation
3. Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure
4. Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
5. Use UV as the package manager
6. Support Python 3.13+

## Success Criteria
- Console application accepts user commands
- All basic todo operations work correctly
- Tasks are stored in memory during application runtime
- Application follows spec-driven development principles
- Repository includes constitution, specs, and implementation
- README.md with setup instructions
