# Phase I Constitution: In-Memory Python Console App

## Project Identity
- **Project**: Todo App - Hackathon II
- **Phase**: I
- **Title**: In-Memory Python Console App
- **Deadline**: January 2, 2026
- **Points**: 100
- **Start Date**: December 2025
- **Status**: Complete
- **Team**: Individual Developer
- **Project Manager**: Self

## Core Purpose
To create a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory, implementing basic CRUD operations using spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. This serves as the foundational phase for the complete evolution of the todo application from console app to cloud-native AI system.

## Mission Statement
Build a robust, well-documented, and spec-compliant console-based todo application that demonstrates mastery of spec-driven development principles while implementing all required functionality using AI-assisted development tools.

## Vision Statement
Create a foundation that seamlessly integrates with future phases, establishing best practices for spec-driven development that will scale through the complete evolution from console app to AI-powered cloud-native system.
