# Phase II Constitution: Full-Stack Web Application

## Project Identity
- **Project**: Todo App - Full-Stack Web Application
- **Phase**: II
- **Deadline**: January 9, 2026
- **Points**: 200

## Core Purpose
To evolve the in-memory Python console application from Phase I into a full-stack web application with user authentication, database persistence, and modern UI/UX, while maintaining the spec-driven development approach with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Values & Constraints
1. All code must be generated using Claude Code (no manual coding)
2. All features must be specified in markdown files before implementation
3. Follow clean code principles and proper web application architecture
4. Implement all Phase II features (User Authentication, Enhanced Task Management, Responsive UI)
5. Use the specified tech stack: Next.js 16+, Python FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB
6. Maintain compatibility with existing Phase I data models and business logic
7. Support responsive design for multiple device types
8. Implement proper security measures for user authentication

## Success Criteria
- Full-stack web application with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
- User authentication system with registration and login
- Database persistence replacing in-memory storage
- All 5 Phase I features enhanced with web interface and database storage
- Responsive UI that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Proper API endpoints for all functionality
- Application follows spec-driven development principles
- Repository includes all systematic documentation
- Deployable to cloud hosting platform

## Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. Must use spec-driven development approach with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus
2. Must implement all Phase II features:
   - User Authentication: Registration, login, session management
   - Enhanced Task Management: CRUD operations with database persistence
   - Responsive UI: Works on multiple device types
   - API Development: RESTful endpoints for all functionality
   - Data Export: PDF/CSV export capabilities
3. Must maintain backward compatibility with Phase I data models
4. Must include proper error handling and security measures
5. Must have clean, readable code structure following web development best practices
6. Must include comprehensive documentation following the 6-document systematic approach
7. Must be deployable to a cloud platform

## Architecture Constraints
- Frontend: Next.js 16+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python FastAPI server
- Database: SQLModel with Neon DB
- Development: Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus, UV package manager
- Must maintain separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Must implement proper API security with authentication middleware

## Quality Standards
- PEP 8 compliance for Python backend code
- TypeScript best practices for frontend code
- Responsive design principles
- Security best practices for authentication
- Performance optimization for web application
- Accessibility considerations
